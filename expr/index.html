<h1 id="4-expressions">4. Expressions</h1>

<a id="expressionchapter"></a>


<p>\newcommand{\syntax}{_Syntax: _}
\newcommand{\semantics}{_Semantics: _}</p>

<p>Expression types are categorized as <em>primitive</em> or <em>derived</em>.
Primitive expression types include variables and procedure calls.
Derived expression types are not semantically primitive, but can instead
be defined as macros.
Suitable syntax definitions of some of the derived expressions are
given in section~\ref{derivedsection}.</p>

<p>The procedures <code>force</code>, <code>promise?</code>, <code>make-promise</code>, and <code>make-parameter</code>
are also described in this chapter because they are intimately associated
with the <code>delay</code>, <code>delay-force</code>, and <code>parameterize</code> expression types.</p>

<h3 id="4-1-1-variable-references">4.1.1. Variable references</h3>

<p>\begin{entry}{
\pproto{\hyper{variable}}{\exprtype}}</p>

<p>An expression consisting of a variable
(section~\ref{variablesection}) is a variable reference.  The value of
the variable reference is the value stored in the location to which the
variable is bound.  It is an error to reference an
unbound variable.</p>

<pre><code>(define x 28)
x   \ev  28
</code></pre>

<p>\end{entry}</p>

<h3 id="4-1-2-literal-expressions">4.1.2. Literal expressions</h3>

<a id="literalsection"></a>


<p>\begin{entry}{
\proto{quote}{ \hyper{datum}}{\exprtype}
\pproto{\singlequote\hyper{datum}}{\exprtype}
\pproto{\hyper{constant}}{\exprtype}}</p>

<p><code>(quote \hyper{datum</code>)} evaluates to \hyper{datum}.\mainschindex{&lsquo;}
\hyper{Datum}
can be any external representation of a Scheme object (see
section~\ref{externalreps}).  This notation is used to include literal
constants in Scheme code.</p>

<pre><code>(quote a)                     \ev  a
(quote \sharpsign(a b c))     \ev  #(a b c)
(quote (+ 1 2))               \ev  (+ 1 2)
</code></pre>

<p><code>(quote \hyper{datum</code>)} can be abbreviated as
\singlequote\hyper{datum}.  The two notations are equivalent in all
respects.</p>

<pre><code>'a                   \ev  a
'#(a b c)           \ev  #(a b c)
'()                  \ev  ()
'(+ 1 2)             \ev  (+ 1 2)
'(quote a)           \ev  (quote a)
''a                  \ev  (quote a)
</code></pre>

<p>Numerical constants, string constants, character constants, vector
constants, bytevector constants, and boolean constants evaluate to
themselves; they need not be quoted.</p>

<pre><code>'145932    \ev  145932
145932     \ev  145932
'&quot;abc&quot;     \ev  &quot;abc&quot;
&quot;abc&quot;      \ev  &quot;abc&quot;
'#         \ev  #
#          \ev  #
'#(a 10)   \ev  #(a 10)

#u8(64 65) \ev  #u8(64 65)
'#t        \ev  #t
#t         \ev  #t
</code></pre>

<p>As noted in section~\ref{storagemodel}, it is an error to attempt to alter a constant
(i.e.~the value of a literal expression) using a mutation procedure like
<code>set-car!</code> or <code>string-set!</code>.</p>

<p>\end{entry}</p>

<h3 id="4-1-3-procedure-calls">4.1.3. Procedure calls</h3>

<p>\begin{entry}{
\pproto{(\hyper{operator} \hyperi{operand} \dotsfoo)}{\exprtype}}</p>

<p>A procedure call is written by enclosing in parentheses an
expression for the procedure to be called followed by expressions for the arguments to be
passed to it.  The operator and operand expressions are evaluated (in an
unspecified order) and the resulting procedure is passed the resulting
arguments.</p>

<pre><code>(+ 3 4)                   \ev  7
((if #f + *) 3 4)         \ev  12
</code></pre>

<p>The procedures in this document are available as the values of variables exported by the
standard libraries.  For example, the addition and multiplication
procedures in the above examples are the values of the variables <code>+</code>
and <code>*</code> in the base library.  New procedures are created by evaluating \lambdaexp{}s
(see section~\ref{lambda}).</p>

<p>Procedure calls can return any number of values (see \ide{values} in
section~\ref{proceduresection}).
Most of the procedures defined in this report return one
value or, for procedures such as <code>apply</code>, pass on the values returned
by a call to one of their arguments.
Exceptions are noted in the individual descriptions.</p>

<p><em>Note:&nbsp;</em> In contrast to other dialects of Lisp, the order of
evaluation is unspecified, and the operator expression and the operand
expressions are always evaluated with the same evaluation rules.</p>

<p><em>Note:&nbsp;</em>
Although the order of evaluation is otherwise unspecified, the effect of
any concurrent evaluation of the operator and operand expressions is
constrained to be consistent with some sequential order of evaluation.
The order of evaluation may be chosen differently for each procedure call.</p>

<p><em>Note:&nbsp;</em> In many dialects of Lisp, the empty list, {\tt
()}, is a legitimate expression evaluating to itself.  In Scheme, it is an error.</p>

<p>\end{entry}</p>

<h3 id="4-1-4-procedures">4.1.4. Procedures</h3>

<a id="lamba"></a>


<p>\begin{entry}{
\proto{lambda}{ \hyper{formals} \hyper{body}}{\exprtype}}</p>

<p>\syntax
\hyper{Formals} is a formal arguments list as described below,
and \hyper{body} is a sequence of zero or more definitions
followed by one or more expressions.</p>

<p>\semantics
A \lambdaexp{} evaluates to a procedure.  The environment in
effect when the \lambdaexp{} was evaluated is remembered as part of the
procedure.  When the procedure is later called with some actual
arguments, the environment in which the \lambdaexp{} was evaluated will
be extended by binding the variables in the formal argument list to
fresh locations, and the corresponding actual argument values will be stored
in those locations.
(A \defining{fresh} location is one that is distinct from every previously
existing location.)
Next, the expressions in the
body of the lambda expression (which, if it contains definitions,
represents a <code>letrec*</code> form &mdash; see section~\ref{letrecstar})
will be evaluated sequentially in the extended environment.
The results of the last expression in the body will be returned as
the results of the procedure call.</p>

<pre><code>(lambda (x) (+ x x))      \ev  {\em{}a procedure}
((lambda (x) (+ x x)) 4)  \ev  8

(define reverse-subtract
  (lambda (x y) (- y x)))
(reverse-subtract 7 10)         \ev  3

(define add4
  (let ((x 4))
    (lambda (y) (+ x y))))
(add4 6)                        \ev  10
</code></pre>

<p>\hyper{Formals} have one of the following forms:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>{\tt(\hyperi{variable} \dotsfoo)}:
The procedure takes a fixed number of arguments; when the procedure is
called, the arguments will be stored in fresh locations
that are bound to the corresponding variables.</p></li>

<li><p>\hyper{variable}:
The procedure takes any number of arguments; when the procedure is
called, the sequence of actual arguments is converted into a newly
allocated list, and the list is stored in a fresh location
that is bound to
\hyper{variable}.</p></li>

<li><p>{\tt(\hyperi{variable} \dotsfoo{} \hyper{variable$<em>{n}$} {\bf.}<br />
\hyper{variable$</em>{n+1}$})}:
If a space-delimited period precedes the last variable, then
the procedure takes $n$ or more arguments, where $n$ is the
number of formal arguments before the period (it is an error if there is not
at least one).
The value stored in the binding of the last variable will be a
newly allocated
list of the actual arguments left over after all the other actual
arguments have been matched up against the other formal arguments.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is an error for a \hyper{variable} to appear more than once in
\hyper{formals}.</p>

<pre><code>((lambda x x) 3 4 5 6)          \ev  (3 4 5 6)
((lambda (x y . z) z)
 3 4 5 6)                       \ev  (5 6)
</code></pre>

<p>\end{entry}</p>

<p>Each procedure created as the result of evaluating a \lambdaexp{} is
(conceptually) tagged
with a storage location, in order to make \ide{eqv?} and
\ide{eq?} work on procedures (see section~\ref{equivalencesection}).</p>

<p>\syntax
\hyper{Test}, \hyper{consequent}, and \hyper{alternate} are
expressions.</p>

<p>\semantics
An <code>if</code> expression is evaluated as follows: first,
\hyper{test} is evaluated.  If it yields a true value (see
section~\ref{booleansection}), then \hyper{consequent} is evaluated and
its values are returned.  Otherwise \hyper{alternate} is evaluated and its
values are returned.  If \hyper{test} yields a false value and no
\hyper{alternate} is specified, then the result of the expression is
unspecified.</p>

<pre><code>(if (&gt; 3 2) 'yes 'no)           \ev  yes

<a id="assignment"></a>


<p>\begin{entry}{
\proto{set!}{ \hyper{variable} \hyper{expression}}{\exprtype}}</p>

<p>\semantics
\hyper{Expression} is evaluated, and the resulting value is stored in
the location to which \hyper{variable} is bound.  It is an error if \hyper{variable} is not
bound either in some region enclosing the <code>set!</code> expression
or else globally.
The result of the <code>set!</code> expression is
unspecified.</p>

<pre><code>(define x 2)
(+ x 1)                 \ev  3
(set! x 4)              \ev  \unspecified

\proto{include}{ \hyperi{string} \hyperii{string} \dotsfoo}{\exprtype}
\rproto{include-ci}{ \hyperi{string} \hyperii{string} \dotsfoo}{\exprtype}}</p>

<p>\semantics
Both \ide{include} and
\ide{include-ci} take one or more filenames expressed as string literals,
apply an implementation-specific algorithm to find corresponding files,
read the contents of the files in the specified order as if by repeated applications
of <code>read</code>,
and effectively replace the <code>include</code> or <code>include-ci</code> expression
with a <code>begin</code> expression containing what was read from the files.
The difference between the two is that \ide{include-ci} reads each file
as if it began with the {\cf{}#!fold-case} directive, while \ide{include}
does not.</p>

<p><em>Note:&nbsp;</em>
Implementations are encouraged to search for files in the directory
which contains the including file, and to provide a way for users to
specify other directories to search.</p>

<p>\semantics
A <code>cond</code> expression is evaluated by evaluating the \hyper{test}
expressions of successive \hyper{clause}s in order until one of them
evaluates to a true value (see
section~\ref{booleansection}).  When a \hyper{test} evaluates to a true
value, the remaining \hyper{expression}s in its \hyper{clause} are
evaluated in order, and the results of the last \hyper{expression} in the
\hyper{clause} are returned as the results of the entire <code>cond</code>

evaluated and its result is compared against each \hyper{datum}.  If the
result of evaluating \hyper{key} is the same (in the sense of
<code>eqv?</code>; see section~\ref{eqv?}) to a \hyper{datum}, then the

<p>\syntax
The \ide{cond-expand} expression type
provides a way to statically
expand different expressions depending on the
implementation.  A
\hyper{ce-clause} takes the following form:</p>

<p>{\tt(\hyper{feature requirement} \hyper{expression} \dotsfoo)}</p>

<p>The last clause can be an &ldquo;else clause,&rdquo; which has the form</p>

<p>{\tt(else \hyper{expression} \dotsfoo)}</p>

<p>A \hyper{feature requirement} takes one of the following forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>{\tt\hyper{feature identifier}}</li>
<li>{\tt(library \hyper{library name})}</li>
<li>{\tt(and \hyper{feature requirement} \dotsfoo)}</li>
<li>{\tt(or \hyper{feature requirement} \dotsfoo)}</li>
<li>{\tt(not \hyper{feature requirement})}</li>
</ul>

<p>\semantics
Each implementation maintains a list of feature identifiers which are
present, as well as a list of libraries which can be imported.  The
value of a \hyper{feature requirement} is determined by replacing
each \hyper{feature identifier} and {\tt(library \hyper{library name})}
on the implementation&rsquo;s lists with \schtrue, and all other feature
identifiers and library names with \schfalse, then evaluating the
resulting expression as a Scheme boolean expression under the normal
interpretation of <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.</p>

<p>A \ide{cond-expand} is then expanded by evaluating the
\hyper{feature requirement}s of successive \hyper{ce-clause}s
in order until one of them returns \schtrue.  When a true clause is
found, the corresponding \hyper{expression}s are expanded to a
<code>begin</code>, and the remaining clauses are ignored.
If none of the \hyper{feature requirement}s evaluate to \schtrue, then
if there is an else clause, its \hyper{expression}s are
included.  Otherwise, the behavior of the \ide{cond-expand} is unspecified.
Unlike <code>cond</code>, <code>cond-expand</code> does not depend on the value
of any variables.</p>

<p>The exact features provided are implementation-defined, but for
portability a core set of features is given in
appendix B.</p>

<h3 id="4-2-2-binding-constructs">4.2.2. Binding constructs</h3>

<a id="bindingsection"></a>


<p>The binding constructs <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, <code>letrec*</code>,
<code>let-values</code>, and <code>let*-values</code>
give Scheme a block structure, like Algol 60.  The syntax of the first four
constructs is identical, but they differ in the regions they establish
for their variable bindings.  In a <code>let</code> expression, the initial
values are computed before any of the variables become bound; in a
<code>let*</code> expression, the bindings and evaluations are performed
sequentially; while in <code>letrec</code> and <code>letrec*</code> expressions,
all the bindings are in

<p>\syntax
All of \hyper{init}, \hyper{step}, \hyper{test}, and \hyper{command}

<p>\semantics
A <code>do</code> expression is an iteration construct.  It specifies a set of variables to
be bound, how they are to be initialized at the start, and how they are
to be updated on each iteration.  When a termination condition is met,
the loop exits after evaluating the \hyper{expression}s.</p>

<p>A <code>do</code> expression is evaluated as follows:
The \hyper{init} expressions are evaluated (in some unspecified order),
the \hyper{variable}s are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
\hyper{init} expressions are stored in the bindings of the
\hyper{variable}s, and then the iteration phase begins.</p>

<p>Each iteration begins by evaluating \hyper{test}; if the result is
false (see section~\ref{booleansection}), then the \hyper{command}
expressions are evaluated in order for effect, the \hyper{step}
expressions are evaluated in some unspecified order, the
\hyper{variable}s are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
\hyper{step}s are stored in the bindings of the
\hyper{variable}s, and the next iteration begins.</p>

<p>If \hyper{test} evaluates to a true value, then the
\hyper{expression}s are evaluated from left to right and the values of
the last \hyper{expression} are returned.  If no \hyper{expression}s
are present, then the value of the <code>do</code> expression is unspecified.</p>

<p>The region of the binding of a \hyper{variable}
consists of the entire <code>do</code> expression except for the \hyper{init}s.
It is an error for a \hyper{variable} to appear more than once in the
list of <code>do</code> variables.</p>

<p>A \hyper{step} can be omitted, in which case the effect is the
same as if {\cf(\hyper{variable} \hyper{init} \hyper{variable})} had
been written instead of {\cf(\hyper{variable} \hyper{init})}.</p>

\proto{delay}{ \hyper{expression}}{lazy library syntax}}</p>

<p>\semantics
The <code>delay</code> construct is used together with the procedure \ide{force} to
implement \defining{lazy evaluation} or \defining{call by need}.
{\tt(delay~\hyper{expression})} returns an object called a
\defining{promise} which at some point in the future can be asked (by
the <code>force</code> procedure) to evaluate
\hyper{expression}, and deliver the resulting value.</p>

<p>The effect of \hyper{expression} returning multiple values
is unspecified.</p>

<p>\end{entry}</p>

<p>\begin{entry}{
\proto{delay-force}{ \hyper{expression}}{lazy library syntax}}</p>

<p>\semantics
The expression <code>(delay-force \var{expression</code>)} is conceptually similar to
<code>(delay (force \var{expression</code>))},
with the difference that forcing the result
of <code>delay-force</code> will in effect result in a tail call to
<code>(force \var{expression</code>)},
while forcing the result of
<code>(delay (force \var{expression</code>))}
might not.  Thus
iterative lazy algorithms that might result in a long series of chains of
<code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>
can be rewritten using <code>delay-force</code> to prevent consuming
unbounded space during evaluation.</p>

<p>\end{entry}</p>

<p>\begin{entry}{
\proto{force}{ promise}{lazy library procedure}}</p>

<p>The <code>force</code> procedure forces the value of a \var{promise} created
by \ide{delay}, \ide{delay-force}, or \ide{make-promise}.
If no value has been computed for the promise, then a value is
computed and returned.  The value of the promise must be cached (or
&ldquo;memoized&rdquo;) so that if it is forced a second time, the previously
computed value is returned.
Consequently, a delayed expression is evaluated using the parameter
values and exception handler of the call to <code>force</code> which first
requested its value.
If \var{promise} is not a promise, it may be returned unchanged.</p>

<pre><code>(force (delay (+ 1 2)))   \ev  3
(let ((p (delay (+ 1 2))))
  (list (force p) (force p)))

</code></pre>

<p>The following example is a mechanical transformation of a lazy
stream-filtering algorithm into Scheme.  Each call to a constructor is
wrapped in <code>delay</code>, and each argument passed to a deconstructor is
wrapped in <code>force</code>.  The use of <code>(delay-force ...)</code> instead of {\cf
(delay (force &hellip;))} around the body of the procedure ensures that an
ever-growing sequence of pending promises does not
exhaust available storage,
because <code>force</code> will in effect force such sequences iteratively.</p>

<pre><code>(define (stream-filter p? s)
  (delay-force
   (if (null? (force s))
       (delay '())
       (let ((h (car (force s)))
             (t (cdr (force s))))
         (if (p? h)
             (delay (cons h (stream-filter p? t)))
             (stream-filter p? t))))))

(head (tail (tail (stream-filter odd? integers))))
                               \ev 5
</code></pre>

<p>The following examples are not intended to illustrate good programming
style, as <code>delay</code>, <code>force</code>, and <code>delay-force</code> are mainly intended
for programs written in the functional style.
However, they do illustrate the property that only one value is
computed for a promise, no matter how many times it is forced.</p>

<pre><code>(define count 0)
(define p

return the object.</p></li>

<li><p>It may be the case that there is no means by which a promise can be

<li>Implementations may implement &ldquo;implicit forcing,&rdquo; where
the value of a promise is forced by procedures
that operate only on arguments of a certain type, like <code>cdr</code>

<p>\syntax
Each \hyper{cond clause} is as in the specification of <code>cond</code>.</p>

<p>\semantics
The \hyper{body} is evaluated with an exception
handler that binds the raised object (see \ide{raise} in section~\ref{exceptionsection})
to \hyper{variable} and, within the scope of
that binding, evaluates the clauses as if they were the clauses of a
<code>cond</code> expression. That implicit <code>cond</code> expression is evaluated with the
continuation and dynamic environment of the <code>guard</code> expression. If every
\hyper{cond clause}&rsquo;s \hyper{test} evaluates to <span class="tt">#f</span> and there
is no else clause, then
<code>raise-continuable</code> is invoked on the raised object within the dynamic
environment of the original call to <code>raise</code>
or <code>raise-continuable</code>, except that the current
exception handler is that of the <code>guard</code> expression.</p>

<p>See section~\ref{exceptionsection} for a more complete discussion of
exceptions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quasiquote&rdquo; expressions are useful
for constructing a list or vector structure when some but not all of the
desired structure is known in advance.  If no
commas appear within the \hyper{qq template}, the result of
evaluating
\backquote\hyper{qq template} is equivalent to the result of evaluating
\singlequote\hyper{qq template}.  If a comma\mainschindex{,} appears within the
\hyper{qq template}, however, the expression following the comma is
evaluated (&ldquo;unquoted&rdquo;) and its result is inserted into the structure
instead of the comma and the expression.  If a comma appears followed
without intervening whitespace by a commercial at-sign (\atsign),\mainschindex{,@} then it is an error if the following
expression does not evaluate to a list; the opening and closing parentheses
of the list are then &ldquo;stripped away&rdquo; and the elements of the list are
inserted in place of the comma at-sign expression sequence.  A comma
at-sign normally appears only within a list or vector \hyper{qq template}.</p>

<p><em>Note:&nbsp;</em>
In order to unquote an identifier beginning with <code>@</code>, it is necessary
to use either an explicit <code>unquote</code> or to put whitespace after the comma,
to avoid colliding with the comma at-sign sequence.</p>

<pre><code>`(list ,(+ 1 2) 4)  \ev  (list 3 4)

</code></pre>

<p>Quasiquote expressions can be nested.  Substitutions are made only for
unquoted components appearing at the same nesting level
as the outermost quasiquote.  The nesting level increases by one inside
each successive quasiquotation, and decreases by one inside each
unquotation.</p>

<pre><code>`(a `(b ,(+ 1 2) ,(foo ,(+ 1 3) d) e) f)

  `(a `(b ,,name1 ,',name2 d) e))
          \lev  (a `(b ,x ,'y d) e)
</code></pre>

<p>A quasiquote expression may return either newly allocated, mutable objects or
literal structure for any structure that is constructed at run time
during the evaluation of the expression. Portions that do not need to
be rebuilt are always literal. Thus,</p>

<pre><code>(let ((a 3)) `((1 2) ,a ,4 ,'five 6))
</code></pre>

<p>may be treated as equivalent to either of the following expressions:</p>

<pre><code>`((1 2) 3 4 five 6)

(let ((a 3))
  (cons '(1 2)
        (cons a (cons 4 (cons 'five '(6))))))
</code></pre>

<p>However, it is not equivalent to this expression:</p>

<pre><code>(let ((a 3)) (list (list 1 2) a 4 'five 6))
</code></pre>

<p>The two notations
 \backquote\hyper{qq template} and {\tt (quasiquote \hyper{qq template})}
 are identical in all respects.
 {\cf,\hyper{expression}} is identical to <code>(unquote \hyper{expression</code>)},
 and
 {\cf,@\hyper{expression}} is identical to <code>(unquote-splicing \hyper{expression</code>)}.
The \ide{write} procedure may output either format.

<h2 id="4-3-macros">4.3. Macros</h2>

<a id="macrosection"></a>


<p>Scheme programs can define and use new derived expression types,
 called <em>macros</em>.
Program-defined expression types have the syntax</p>

<pre><code>(\hyper{keyword} {\hyper{datum}} ...)
</code></pre>

<p>where \hyper{keyword} is an identifier that uniquely determines the
expression type.  This identifier is called the <em>syntactic
keyword</em>, or simply {\em
keyword}, of the macro.  The
number of the \hyper{datum}s, and their syntax, depends on the
expression type.</p>

<p>Each instance of a macro is called a <em>use</em>
of the macro.
The set of rules that specifies
how a use of a macro is transcribed into a more primitive expression
is called the <em>transformer</em>
of the macro.</p>

<p>The macro definition facility consists of two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A set of expressions used to establish that certain identifiers
are macro keywords, associate them with macro transformers, and control
the scope within which a macro is defined, and</p></li>

<li><p>a pattern language for specifying macro transformers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The syntactic keyword of a macro can shadow variable bindings, and local
variable bindings can shadow syntactic bindings.
Two mechanisms are provided to prevent unintended conflicts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If a macro transformer inserts a binding for an identifier
(variable or keyword), the identifier will in effect be renamed
throughout its scope to avoid conflicts with other identifiers.
Note that a global variable definition may or may not introduce a binding;
see section~\ref{defines}.</p></li>

<li><p>If a macro transformer inserts a free reference to an
identifier, the reference refers to the binding that was visible
where the transformer was specified, regardless of any local
bindings that surround the use of the macro.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In consequence, all macros
defined using the pattern language  are &ldquo;hygienic&rdquo; and &ldquo;referentially
transparent&rdquo; and thus preserve Scheme&rsquo;s lexical scoping. <a href="../ref/#Kohlbecker86">[Kohlbecker86]</a><a href="../ref/#hygienic">[hygienic]</a><a href="../ref/#Bawden88">[Bawden88]</a><a href="../ref/#macrosthatwork">[macrosthatwork]</a><a href="../ref/#syntacticabstraction">[syntacticabstraction]</a></p>

<p>Implementations may provide macro facilities of other types.</p>

\pproto{\dotsfoo}{\auxiliarytype}}
\mainschindex{</em>}</p>

<p>\syntax
It is an error if any of the \hyper{literal}s, or the \hyper{ellipsis} in the second form,
is not an identifier.
It is also an error if
\hyper{syntax rule} is not of the form</p>

<pre><code>(\hyper{pattern} \hyper{template})
</code></pre>

<p>The \hyper{pattern} in a \hyper{syntax rule} is a list \hyper{pattern}
whose first element is an identifier.</p>

<p>A \hyper{pattern} is either an identifier, a constant, or one of the
following</p>

<pre><code>(\hyper{pattern} \ldots)
(\hyper{pattern} \hyper{pattern} \ldots . \hyper{pattern})
(\hyper{pattern} \ldots \hyper{pattern} \hyper{ellipsis} \hyper{pattern} \ldots)
(\hyper{pattern} \ldots \hyper{pattern} \hyper{ellipsis} \hyper{pattern} \ldots
  . \hyper{pattern})
#(\hyper{pattern} \ldots)
#(\hyper{pattern} \ldots \hyper{pattern} \hyper{ellipsis} \hyper{pattern} \ldots)
</code></pre>

<p>and a \hyper{template} is either an identifier, a constant, or one of the following</p>

<pre><code>(\hyper{element} \ldots)
(\hyper{element} \hyper{element} \ldots . \hyper{template})
(\hyper{ellipsis} \hyper{template})
#(\hyper{element} \ldots)
</code></pre>

<p>where an \hyper{element} is a \hyper{template} optionally
followed by an \hyper{ellipsis}.
An \hyper{ellipsis} is the identifier specified in the second form
of <code>syntax-rules</code>, or the default identifier <code>...</code>
(three consecutive periods) otherwise.\schindex{&hellip;}</p>

<p>\semantics An instance of <code>syntax-rules</code> produces a new macro
transformer by specifying a sequence of hygienic rewrite rules.  A use
of a macro whose keyword is associated with a transformer specified by
<code>syntax-rules</code> is matched against the patterns contained in the
\hyper{syntax rule}s, beginning with the leftmost \hyper{syntax rule}.
When a match is found, the macro use is transcribed hygienically
according to the template.</p>

<p>An identifier appearing within a \hyper{pattern} can be an underscore
(<code>_</code>), a literal identifier listed in the list of \hyper{literal}s,
or the \hyper{ellipsis}.
All other identifiers appearing within a \hyper{pattern} are
<em>pattern variables</em>.</p>

<p>The keyword at the beginning of the pattern in a
\hyper{syntax rule} is not involved in the matching and
is considered neither a pattern variable nor a literal identifier.</p>

<p>Pattern variables match arbitrary input elements and
are used to refer to elements of the input in the template.
It is an error for the same pattern variable to appear more than once in a
\hyper{pattern}.</p>

<p>Underscores also match arbitrary input elements but are not pattern variables
and so cannot be used to refer to those elements.  If an underscore appears
in the \hyper{literal}s list, then that takes precedence and
underscores in the \hyper{pattern} match as literals.
Multiple underscores can appear in a \hyper{pattern}.</p>

<p>Identifiers that appear in \texttt{(\hyper{literal} \dotsfoo)} are
interpreted as literal
identifiers to be matched against corresponding elements of the input.
An element in the input matches a literal identifier if and only if it is an
identifier and either both its occurrence in the macro expression and its
occurrence in the macro definition have the same lexical binding, or
the two identifiers are the same and both have no lexical binding.</p>

<p>A subpattern followed by \hyper{ellipsis} can match zero or more elements of
the input, unless \hyper{ellipsis} appears in the \hyper{literal}s, in which
case it is matched as a literal.</p>

<p>More formally, an input expression $E$ matches a pattern $P$ if and only if:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$P$ is an underscore (<code>_</code>).</p></li>

<li><p>$P$ is a non-literal identifier; or</p></li>

<li><p>$P$ is a literal identifier and $E$ is an identifier with the same
  binding; or</p></li>

<li><p>$P$ is a list <code>($P_1$ $\dots$ $P_n$)</code> and $E$ is a
  list of $n$
  elements that match $P_1$ through $P_n$, respectively; or</p></li>

<li><p>$P$ is an improper list
  <code>($P_1$ $P_2$ $\dots$ $P_n$ . $P_{n+1</code>$)}
  and $E$ is a list or
  improper list of $n$ or more elements that match $P_1$ through $P<em>n$,
  respectively, and whose $n$th tail matches $P</em>{n+1}$; or</p></li>

<li><p>$P$ is of the form
  <code>($P_1$ $\dots$ $P_k$ $P_e$ \meta{ellipsis</code> $P_{m+1}$ \dotsfoo{} $P_n$)}
  where $E$ is
  a proper list of $n$ elements, the first $k$ of which match
  $P_1$ through $P_k$, respectively,
  whose next $m-k$ elements each match $P<em>e$,
  whose remaining $n-m$ elements match $P</em>{m+1}$ through $P_n$; or</p></li>

<li><p>$P$ is of the form
  <code>($P_1$ $\dots$ $P_k$ $P_{e</code>$ \meta{ellipsis} $P_{m+1}$ \dotsfoo{} $P_n$ . $P_x$)}
  where $E$ is
  a list or improper list of $n$ elements, the first $k$ of which match
  $P_1$ through $P_k$,
  whose next $m-k$ elements each match $P<em>e$,
  whose remaining $n-m$ elements match $P</em>{m+1}$ through $P_n$,
  and whose $n$th and final cdr matches $P_x$; or</p></li>

<li><p>$P$ is a vector of the form <code>#($P_1$ $\dots$ $P_n$)</code>
  and $E$ is a vector
  of $n$ elements that match $P_1$ through $P_n$; or</p></li>

<li><p>$P$ is of the form
  <code>#($P_1$ $\dots$ $P_k$ $P_{e</code>$ \meta{ellipsis} $P_{m+1}$ \dotsfoo $P_n$)}
  where $E$ is a vector of $n$
  elements the first $k$ of which match $P_1$ through $P_k$,
  whose next $m-k$ elements each match $P<em>e$,
  and whose remaining $n-m$ elements match $P</em>{m+1}$ through $P_n$; or</p></li>

<li><p>$P$ is a constant and $E$ is equal to $P$ in the sense of
  the <code>equal?</code> procedure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is an error to use a macro keyword, within the scope of its
binding, in an expression that does not match any of the patterns.</p>

<p>When a macro use is transcribed according to the template of the
matching \hyper{syntax rule}, pattern variables that occur in the
template are replaced by the elements they match in the input.
Pattern variables that occur in subpatterns followed by one or more
instances of the identifier
\hyper{ellipsis} are allowed only in subtemplates that are
followed by as many instances of \hyper{ellipsis}.
They are replaced in the
output by all of the elements they match in the input, distributed as
indicated.  It is an error if the output cannot be built up as
specified.</p>

<p>%%% This description of output construction is very vague.  It should
%%% probably be formalized, but that is not easy&hellip;</p>

<p>Identifiers that appear in the template but are not pattern variables
or the identifier
\hyper{ellipsis} are inserted into the output as literal identifiers.  If a
literal identifier is inserted as a free identifier then it refers to the
binding of that identifier within whose scope the instance of
<code>syntax-rules</code> appears.
If a literal identifier is inserted as a bound identifier then it is
in effect renamed to prevent inadvertent captures of free identifiers.</p>

<p>A template of the form
<code>(\hyper{ellipsis</code> \hyper{template})} is identical to \hyper{template},
except that
ellipses within the template have no special meaning.
That is, any ellipses contained within \hyper{template} are
treated as ordinary identifiers.
In particular, the template <code>(\hyper{ellipsis</code> \hyper{ellipsis})} produces
a single \hyper{ellipsis}.
This allows syntactic abstractions to expand into code containing
ellipses.</p>

<pre><code>(define-syntax be-like-begin
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((be-like-begin name)
     (define-syntax name
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((name expr (... ...))
          (begin expr (... ...))))))))

(be-like-begin sequence)
(sequence 1 2 3 4) \ev 4
</code></pre>

<p>As an example, if \ide{let} and \ide{cond} are defined as in
section~\ref{derivedsection} then they are hygienic (as required) and
the following is not an error.</p>

<pre><code>(let ((=&gt; \schfalse))
  (cond (\schtrue =&gt; 'ok)))           \ev ok
</code></pre>

<p>The macro transformer for <code>cond</code> recognizes <code>=&gt;</code>
as a local variable, and hence an expression, and not as the
base identifier <code>=&gt;</code>, which the macro transformer treats
as a syntactic keyword.  Thus the example expands into</p>

<pre><code>(let ((=&gt; \schfalse))
  (if \schtrue (begin =&gt; 'ok)))
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>(let ((=&gt; \schfalse))
  (let ((temp \schtrue))
    (if temp ('ok temp))))
</code></pre>

<p>which would result in an invalid procedure call.</p>
