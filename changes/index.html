<h3 id="incompatibilities-with-hahahugoshortcode-1hbhb">Incompatibilities with R<span class="rnrs">5</span>RS</h3>

<a id="incompatibilities"></a>


<p>This section enumerates the incompatibilities between this report and
the &ldquo;Revised$^5$ report&rdquo; <a href="../ref/#R5RS">[R5RS]</a>.</p>

<p><em>This list is not authoritative, but is believed to be correct and complete.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Case sensitivity is now the default in symbols and character names.
This means that code written under the assumption that symbols could be
written <code>FOO</code> or <code>Foo</code> in some contexts and <code>foo</code> in other contexts
can either be changed, be marked with the new <code>#!fold-case</code> directive,
or be included in a library using the <code>include-ci</code> library declaration.
All standard identifiers are entirely in lower case.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>syntax-rules</code> construct now recognizes ___ (underscore)
as a wildcard, which means it cannot be used as a syntax variable.
It can still be used as a literal.</p></li>

<li><p>The R<span class="rnrs">5</span>RS procedures <code>exact-&gt;inexact</code> and <code>inexact-&gt;exact</code>
have been renamed to their R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS names, <code>inexact</code> and <code>exact</code>,
respectively, as these names are shorter and more correct.
The former names are still available in the R<span class="rnrs">5</span>RS library.</p></li>

<li><p>The guarantee that string comparison (with <code>string&lt;?</code> and the
related predicates) is a lexicographical extension of character comparison
(with <code>char&lt;?</code> and the related predicates) has been removed.</p></li>

<li><p>Support for the # character in numeric literals is no longer required.</p></li>

<li><p>Support for the letters <code>s</code>, <code>f</code>, <code>d</code>, and <code>l</code>
as exponent markers is no longer required.</p></li>

<li><p>Implementations of <code>string\coerce{</code>number} are no longer permitted
to return \schfalse{} when the argument contains an explicit radix prefix,
and must be compatible with <code>read</code> and the syntax of numbers in programs.</p></li>

<li><p>The procedures <code>transcript-on</code> and <code>transcript-off</code> have been removed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-language-changes-since-hahahugoshortcode-7hbhb">Other language changes since R<span class="rnrs">5</span>RS</h3>

<p><a id="differences"></a>

This section enumerates the additional differences between this report and
the &ldquo;Revised$^5$ report&rdquo; <a href="../ref/#R5RS">[R5RS]</a>.</p>

<p><em>This list is not authoritative, but is believed to be correct and complete.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Various minor ambiguities and unclarities in R<span class="rnrs">5</span>RS have been cleaned up.</p></li>

<li><p>Libraries have been added as a new program structure to improve
encapsulation and sharing of code.  Some existing and new identifiers
have been factored out into separate libraries.
Libraries can be imported into other libraries or main programs, with
controlled exposure and renaming of identifiers.
The contents of a library can be made conditional on the features of
the implementation on which it is to be used.
There is an R<span class="rnrs">5</span>RS compatibility library.</p></li>

<li><p>The expressions types <code>include</code>, <code>include-ci</code>, and <code>cond-expand</code>
have been added to the base library; they have the same semantics as the
corresponding library declarations.</p></li>

<li><p>Exceptions can now be signaled explicitly with <code>raise</code>,
<code>raise-continuable</code> or <code>error</code>, and can be handled with {\cf
with-exception-handler} and the <code>guard</code> syntax.
Any object can specify an error condition; the implementation-defined
conditions signaled by <code>error</code> have a predicate to detect them and accessor functions to
retrieve the arguments passed to <code>error</code>.
Conditions signaled by <code>read</code> and by file-related procedures
also have predicates to detect them.</p></li>

<li><p>New disjoint types supporting access to multiple fields can be
generated with the <code>define-record-type</code> of SRFI 9 <a href="../ref/#srfi9">[srfi9]</a></p></li>

<li><p>Parameter objects can be created with <code>make-parameter</code>, and
dynamically rebound with <code>parameterize</code>.
The procedures <code>current-input-port</code> and <code>current-output-port</code> are now
parameter objects, as is the newly introduced <code>current-error-port</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Support for promises has been enhanced based on SRFI 45 <a href="../ref/#srfi45">[srfi45]</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Bytevectors</em>, vectors of exact integers in the range
from 0 to 255 inclusive, have been added as a new disjoint type.
A subset of the vector procedures is provided.  Bytevectors
can be converted to and from strings in accordance with the UTF-8 character encoding.
Bytevectors have a datum representation and evaluate to themselves.</p></li>

<li><p>Vector constants evaluate to themselves.</p></li>

<li><p>The procedure <code>read-line</code> is provided to make line-oriented textual input
simpler.</p></li>

<li><p>The procedure <code>flush-output-port</code> is provided to allow minimal
control of output port buffering.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Ports</em> can now be designated as <em>textual</em> or {\em
binary} ports, with new procedures for reading and writing binary
data.
The new predicates <code>input-port-open?</code> and <code>output-port-open?</code> return whether a port is open or closed.
The new procedure <code>close-port</code> now closes a port; if the port
has both input and output sides, both are closed.</p></li>

<li><p><em>String ports</em> have been added as a way to read and write
characters to and from strings, and <em>bytevector ports</em> to read
and write bytes to and from bytevectors.</p></li>

<li><p>There are now I/O procedures specific to strings and bytevectors.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>write</code> procedure now generates datum labels when applied to
circular objects.  The new procedure <code>write-simple</code> never generates
labels; <code>write-shared</code> generates labels for all shared and circular
structure.
The <code>display</code> procedure must not loop on circular objects.</p></li>

<li><p>The R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS procedure <code>eof-object</code> has been added.
Eof-objects are now required to be a disjoint type.</p></li>

<li><p>Syntax definitions are now allowed wherever variable definitions are.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>syntax-rules</code> construct now allows
the ellipsis symbol to be specified explicitly instead of the default
<code>...</code>, allows template escapes with an ellipsis-prefixed list, and
allows tail patterns to follow an ellipsis pattern.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>syntax-error</code> syntax has been added as a way to signal immediate
and more informative errors when a macro is expanded.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>letrec*</code> binding construct has been added, and internal <code>define</code>
is specified in terms of it.</p></li>

<li><p>Support for capturing multiple values has been enhanced with {\cf
define-values}, <code>let-values</code>, and <code>let*-values</code>.
Standard expression types which contain a sequence of expressions now
permit passing zero or more than one value to the continuations of all
non-final expressions of the sequence.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>case</code> conditional now supports {\tt =&gt;} syntax
analogous to <code>cond</code> not only in regular clauses but in the {\cf
else} clause as well.</p></li>

<li><p>To support dispatching on the number of arguments passed to a
procedure, <code>case-lambda</code> has been added in its own library.</p></li>

<li><p>The convenience conditionals <code>when</code> and <code>unless</code> have been added.</p></li>

<li><p>The behavior of <code>eqv?</code> on inexact numbers now conforms to the
R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS definition.</p></li>

<li><p>When applied to procedures, <code>eq?</code> and <code>eqv?</code> are permitted to
return different answers.</p></li>

<li><p>The R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS procedures <code>boolean=?</code> and <code>symbol=?</code> have been added.</p></li>

<li><p>Positive infinity, negative infinity, NaN, and negative inexact zero have been added
to the numeric tower as inexact values with the written
representations {\tt +inf.0}, {\tt -inf.0}, {\tt +nan.0}, and <code>-0.0</code>
respectively.  Support for them is not required.
The representation {\tt -nan.0} is synonymous with {\tt +nan.0}.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>log</code> procedure now accepts a second argument specifying
the logarithm base.</p></li>

<li><p>The procedures <code>map</code> and <code>for-each</code> are now required to terminate on
the shortest argument list.</p></li>

<li><p>The procedures <code>member</code> and <code>assoc</code> now take an optional third argument
specifying the equality predicate to be used.</p></li>

<li><p>The numeric procedures <code>finite?</code>, <code>infinite?</code>, <code>nan?</code>,
<code>exact-integer?</code>, <code>square</code>, and <code>exact-integer-sqrt</code>
have been added.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>-</code> and <code>/</code> procedures
and the character and string comparison
predicates are now required to support more than two arguments.</p></li>

<li><p>The forms \sharptrue{} and \sharpfalse{} are now supported
as well as \schtrue{} and \schfalse{}.</p></li>

<li><p>The procedures <code>make-list</code>, <code>list-copy</code>, <code>list-set!</code>,
<code>string-map</code>, <code>string-for-each</code>, <code>string-&gt;vector</code>,
<code>vector-append</code>,
<code>vector-copy</code>, <code>vector-map</code>, <code>vector-for-each</code>,
<code>vector-&gt;string</code>, <code>vector-copy!</code>, and <code>string-copy!</code>
have been added to round out the sequence operations.</p></li>

<li><p>Some string and vector procedures support processing of part of a string or vector using
optional \var{start} and \var{end} arguments.</p></li>

<li><p>Some list procedures are now defined on circular lists.</p></li>

<li><p>Implementations may provide any subset of the full Unicode
repertoire that includes ASCII, but implementations must support any
such subset in a way consistent with Unicode.
Various character and string procedures have been extended accordingly,
and case conversion procedures added for strings.
String comparison is no longer
required to be consistent with character comparison, which is based
solely on Unicode scalar values.
The new <code>digit-value</code> procedure has been added to obtain the numerical
value of a numeric character.</p></li>

<li><p>There are now two additional comment syntaxes: {\tt #;} to
skip the next datum, and {\tt #| &hellip; |#}
for nestable block comments.</p></li>

<li><p>Data prefixed with datum labels {\tt #<n>=} can be referenced
with {\tt #<n>#}, allowing for reading and writing of data with
shared structure.</p></li>

<li><p>Strings and symbols now allow mnemonic and numeric escape
sequences, and the list of named characters has been extended.</p></li>

<li><p>The procedures <code>file-exists?</code> and <code>delete-file</code> are available in the
{\tt (scheme file)} library.</p></li>

<li><p>An interface to the system environment, command line, and process exit status is
available in the {\tt (scheme process-context)} library.</p></li>

<li><p>Procedures for accessing time-related values are available in the
{\tt (scheme time)} library.</p></li>

<li><p>A less irregular set of integer division operators is provided
with new and clearer names.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>load</code> procedure now accepts a second argument specifying the environment to
load into.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> procedure now has the synonym
<code>call/cc</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>The semantics of read-eval-print loops are now partly prescribed,
requiring the redefinition of procedures, but not syntax keywords, to have retroactive effect.</p></li>

<li><p>The formal semantics now handles <code>dynamic-wind</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="incompatibilities-with-hahahugoshortcode-17hbhb">Incompatibilities with R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS</h3>

<p>This section enumerates the incompatibilities between R<span class="rnrs">7</span>RS~and
the &ldquo;Revised$^6$ report&rdquo; <a href="../ref/#R6RS">[R6RS]</a> and its accompanying Standard Libraries document.</p>

<p><em>This list is not authoritative, and is possibly incomplete.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>R<span class="rnrs">7</span>RS libraries begin with the keyword <code>define-library</code>
rather than <code>library</code> in order to make them syntactically
distinguishable from R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS libraries.
In R<span class="rnrs">7</span>RS terms, the body of an R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS library consists
of a single export declaration followed by a single import declaration,
followed by commands and definitions.  In R<span class="rnrs">7</span>RS, commands and
definitions are not permitted directly within the body: they have to be be wrapped in a <code>begin</code>
library declaration.</p></li>

<li><p>There is no direct R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS equivalent of the <code>include</code>, <code>include-ci</code>,
<code>include-library-declarations</code>, or <code>cond-expand</code> library declarations.
On the other hand, the R<span class="rnrs">7</span>RS library syntax does not support phase or version specifications.</p></li>

<li><p>The grouping of standardized identifiers into libraries is different from the R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS<br />
approach. In particular, procedures which are optional in R<span class="rnrs">5</span>RS\, either expressly
or by implication, have been removed from the base library.
Only the base library itself is an absolute requirement.</p></li>

<li><p>No form of identifier syntax is provided.</p></li>

<li><p>Internal syntax definitions are allowed, but uses of a syntax form
cannot appear before its definition; the <code>even</code>/<code>odd</code> example given in
R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS is not allowed.</p></li>

<li><p>The R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS exception system was incorporated as-is, but the condition
types have been left unspecified.  In particular, where R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS requires
a condition of a specified type to be signaled, R<span class="rnrs">7</span>RS says only
&ldquo;it is an error&rdquo;, leaving the question of signaling open.</p></li>

<li><p>Full Unicode support is not required.
Normalization is not provided.
Character comparisons are
defined by Unicode, but string comparisons are implementation-dependent.
Non-Unicode characters are permitted.</p></li>

<li><p>The full numeric tower is optional as in R<span class="rnrs">5</span>RS, but optional support for IEEE
infinities, NaN, and {\mbox -0.0} was adopted from R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS. Most clarifications on
numeric results were also adopted, but the R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS procedures <code>real-valued?</code>,
<code>rational-valued?</code>, and <code>integer-valued</code>? were not.
The R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS division operators <code>div</code>, <code>mod</code>, <code>div-and-mod</code>, {\cf
div0}, <code>mod0</code> and <code>div0-and-mod0</code> are not provided.</p></li>

<li><p>When a result is unspecified, it is still required to be a single value.
However, non-final expressions
in a body can return any number of values.</p></li>

<li><p>The semantics of <code>map</code> and <code>for-each</code> have been changed to use
the SRFI 1 <a href="../ref/#srfi1">[srfi1]</a> early termination behavior. Likewise,
<code>assoc</code> and <code>member</code> take an optional <code>equal?</code> argument as in SRFI 1,
instead of the separate <code>assp</code> and <code>memp</code> procedures of R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS.</p></li>

<li><p>The R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS~<code>quasiquote</code> clarifications have been adopted, with the
exception of multiple-argument <code>unquote</code> and
<code>unquote-splicing</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>The R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS~method of specifying mantissa widths was not adopted.</p></li>

<li><p>String ports are compatible with SRFI 6 <a href="../ref/#srfi6">[srfi6]</a> rather than R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS.</p></li>

<li><p>R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS{}-style bytevectors are included, but
only the unsigned byte (<code>u8</code>) procedures have been provided.
The lexical syntax uses <code>#u8</code> for compatibility
with SRFI 4 <a href="../ref/#srfi4">[srfi4]</a>, rather than the R<span class="rnrs">6</span>RS~<code>#vu8</code> style.</p></li>

<li><p>The utility macros <code>when</code> and <code>unless</code> are provided, but
their result is left unspecified.</p></li>

<li><p>The remaining features of the Standard Libraries document were
left to future standardization efforts.</p></li>
